**Note**: Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It is commonly used to categorize individuals into underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese based on their BMI value. However, BMI may not accurately reflect body composition for all individuals, particularly athletes or those with a high muscle mass. Please consult with a healthcare professional for personalized health advice.
